Feature: Hello World ({{language}})
  This is just a simple test to make sure the test runner is working in each language.
  
  {{#my_tags}}
  {{.}}
  {{/my_tags}}
  Scenario: Create server ({{language}})
    Given I am setup to run example code for {{language}}
    When I execute the following code:
"""{{language}}
{{solution}}
"""
    Then the output should match
    """
    Hello, world!
    """
